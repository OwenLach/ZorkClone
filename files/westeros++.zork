Rooms:
Winterfell
Contents: dagger
You stand within a huge castle complex spanning several acres, consisting of
two massive walls and a village located just outside. Banners featuring the
head of a direwolf are flapping in the chilly breeze.
---
The Wall
Contents: BastardSword,dragonglass
This gargantuan structure stretches for 300 miles to the west and east and is
approximately 700 feet tall. It is made of solid ice and stone, and can be
seen for miles round. It appears grey or blue depending on the weather and
time of day. The top is wide enough for a dozen mounted knights to ride
abreast and it is thicker at the base. The Wall has no gates anywhere, simply
a few tunnels cut through it that are secured by heavy iron bars and massive
chains that must be unlocked.
---
The Dreadfort
You enter a strong fortress, with high walls and triangular merlons that look
like sharp stone teeth. It has thick stone walls and massive towers. Its great
hall is dim and smoky, with rows of torches grasped by skeletal human hands
jutting from the walls. Long tables stand before a dais with a high table. The
hall has a vaulted ceiling and wooden rafters.
---
Dragonstone
This is a volcanic island at the mouth of Blackwater Bay, created by a still
active volcano. The island is damp and dreary. A small fortress is located on
the face of the volcano. Outside its walls sits a small fishing village on the
stormy coast.
---
Pentos
Contents: GreenDragonEgg,WhiteDragonEgg,BlackDragonEgg
This large port city has many square brick towers. Most of the roofing is done
in tiles. A large red temple catches the eye.
---
Moat Cailin
Great blocks of black basalt lay scattered about, half sunk in the ground,
where a great wall once stood. A wooden keep, which rotted away a thousand
years past, and three remaining towers out of a fabled twenty are green with
moss.
---
North Kingsroad
You are on a desolate byway that is little more than two narrow dirt tracks.
Vultures circle overhead.
---
Crossroads Inn
A large but rustic structure lies at the convergence of five roads. It is
three stories tall with turrets and chimneys made of white stone. Its south
wing is built upon pilings that rise over a bed of weeds. On the north side
there is a stable with a thatch roof and a bell tower. The building is
surrounded by a low wall of broken white stones.
---
South Kingsroad
This long road stretches to the north and south as far as the eye can see.
Numerous inns and villages lie along its path.
---
Mountains of the Moon
The road you are on is wild and dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills
and thick forests, past high passes and deep chasms. Shadowcats peer and purr
from behind trees. Snow flurries are gathering.
---
Bloody Gate
There are two long parapets built into the stone of the mountains. The pass,
narrow where it meets the gate, is watched over by twin watchtowers, which are
joined by a covered bridge of grey stone that arches above the road.
---
The Eyrie
This breathtaking castle consists only of a cluster of seven slim, white
towers bunched tightly together. It is made of fine white stone. The towers
encircle a garden, which had once been meant as a godswood, but no weirwood
heart tree would take root in the stony soil. The garden, which is overlooked
by overhead apartments, instead contains grass, shrubbery, and statuary.
---
East River Road
The deafening sounds of the Red Fork of the Trident river overwhelm you as you
make your way along this picturesque byway.
---
West River Road
You wander over a meandering road through green, hilly country.
---
Riverrun
You approach a strong three-sided castle, not especially large. It is
bordered on the north by the Tumblestone and on the south by the Red Fork,
while on the west a third side faces a massive man-made ditch. In time of
danger the sluice gates can be opened to fill a wide moat and leave the castle
surrounded on all three sides by water, turning it into an island and
leaving it practically unassailable. It commands a view of many leagues.
The castle has sandstone walls which rise sheer from the water, its
battlements are crenelated and have arrow loops, and its towers command the
opposite shores.
---
Casterly Rock
This fortress is carved out of a great stone colossal rock beside the Sunset
Sea. It resembles a lion in repose at sunset. A ringfort appears on the peak,
as well as walls, gates, and watchtowers. The base of the Rock contains large
sea-carved caverns. The stone has been mined for thousands of years, so there
are hundreds of mineshafts in the depths of the Rock, as well as yet untouched
gold veins. From below the Rock thunder can be heard, where the sea comes in.
---
King's Landing
Contents: wildfire,SapphireNecklace,soulOfTheLords
This extraordinary city is extremely populous, but rather unsightly and dirty
compared to other cities. The city is roughly square-shaped, sprawling across
several miles and defended by tall walls. Poorer smallfolk build shanty
settlements outside the walls. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled
for miles.
---
Harrenhal
A sprawling, nearly abandoned castle has five towers of dizzying size, with
equally monstrous curtain walls. The walls are incredibly thick and its rooms
are built on a scale that would be more comfortable for giants than humans.
However, much of it has far gone into decay. Only the lower thirds of two of
the five towers appear to be occupied. Bats infest the tops of some of the
towers.
